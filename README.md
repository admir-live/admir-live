In the heart of Wilmington, DE, the inception of Penzle marked the beginning of my most recent voyage as a Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer. It was November 2022, a period of anticipation and grand visions, when we set out to challenge the status quo of content management systems. Our mission was clear yet audacious: to forge tools that transcend the barriers of computer science, making technology accessible to all.

My journey into the realm of technology leadership, however, began long before Penzle. It was a path paved with roles that spanned continents, from the vibrant cityscapes of Sarajevo to the bustling streets of London, each chapter contributing to my arsenal of skills and insights. As a believer in Microsoft .NET technologies, I’ve always seen ASP.NET, Entity Framework, .NET Core, and Microsoft Azure not just as tools, but as canvases for innovation.

At Infinity Mesh, my role as a Co-Founder and Global Chief Information Officer offered me a global stage to contribute to technical architectural design and strategic planning. Here, amidst discussions and designs, I cultivated policies and strategies that not only propelled the company forward but also nurtured a culture of innovation.

Each role I’ve embraced, from being a Solutions Architect to an educator, was driven by a singular passion: to solve complex problems with elegant, efficient solutions. My tenure as a Teaching Assistant and researcher further solidified this, allowing me to dive deep into the intricacies of software engineering, algorithm optimization, and more, all while shaping the minds of the next generation of tech pioneers.

What has always intrigued me is not just the development of technology itself, but the stories that unfold from its application—the businesses revolutionized, the jobs created, and the lives changed. My involvement with projects like the novel MyKnow365 system or the backend architecture for Roshambo Live’s massive player base, are testaments to the transformative power of tech when guided by vision and expertise.

The journey is far from over. As I continue to navigate the evolving landscape of technology, my mission remains unchanged: to democratize access to technology, ensuring it serves as a bridge, not a barrier, for innovation.
