# Hi, Iâ€™m Admir Mujkic
As a Co-Founder and CTO at Penzle, I have been leading the research and development of innovative content management tools that are accessible to users without a computer engineering or science background. I have been overseeing the product development, technological strategy, and market research, as well as mediating between upper management and developers. I have also been leveraging my expertise in various technologies, such as databases, software development, and XML, to enable easy integration with different languages, clouds, and apps.

In addition to my role at Penzle, I am also a Co-Founder and Global CIO at Infinity Mesh, where I contribute to the development of policies, strategies, and best practices for delivering technical architectural design, plans, and strategies. I am also a Senior Teaching Assistant at the University of Zenica, where I apply and teach my knowledge in software engineering, control theory, automation, algorithm optimization, and statistical mathematics. I have also published several papers on topics related to NoSQL databases, social network analysis, and digital and emerging technologies.

With more than 15 years of immersion in the technology industry, I am passionate about transforming businesses through cutting-edge technological solutions. I believe firmly in developing strong relationships with clients, contractors, alliance partners, and internal team members. I also envision technology as a catalyst for building bigger, faster, and more profitable ventures. Let's connect and explore how we can turn your business goals into tangible successes!
